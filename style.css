MAKE SURE TO READ BELOW BEFORE GETTING STARTED FOR THE FIRST TIME!
------------------------------------------------------------------

You may be thinking…

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA…WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

But before you freak out, let me take a few minutes to explain.

This fork of Bones uses LESS (http://lesscss.org/) by default. If
you prefer using regular CSS, then feel free to grab the normal Bones
theme from http://themble.com/bones/ and modify it however you like.

DON'T DISMISS IT YET THOUGH, USING LESS ISN'T AS COMPLICATED AS YOU THINK.

It does take a few minutes to wrap your head around, but it will all
be worth it. Need a quick intro? Here are a few quick reads:

http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/09/an-introduction-to-less-and-comparison-to-sass/

Because this version of Bones uses the excellent wp-sass library,
working with Sass files is easier than ever before! Just edit the SCSS-
format stylesheets in library/scss, re-load the site, and your changes
should appear right away--just like you're used to with CSS.

The strength of most programs made for working with LESS is that they
compile your .less files into valid, ordinary CSS. Since this theme
automatically does the compilation for you, you don't technically need
the apps below to work with Bones. They're still pretty awesome,
though, so try them out and see what you think:

CodeKit: (Highly Recommended)

LESS App:

SimpLESS: (Windows Users)

WinLESS: (Windows Users)
http://winless.org/

A QUICK NOTE ABOUT THE LOGIN SCREEN STYLES

The *one* file that doesn't get auto-generated is the login screen
stylesheet, library/less/login.less. To make changes to the login
styles, simply use one of the apps above to edit login.scss, set
the output to the library/css folder and you are all set. It's a
thing of beauty.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, once you download Bones it's up to you how to use it,
so go nuts. Set things up and develop in a way that's easiest for
you.

If you're frustrated with this new direction and don't like change,
take a few minutes and think about how much better a developer you
can become by just TRYING out new technologies. It may be tough at
first but it WILL make you a better developer. TRUST ME ON THIS.
Give it a week, maybe two, and you will never go back.

Happy Developing!
